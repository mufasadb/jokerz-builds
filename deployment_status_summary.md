# Deployment Status Summary

## Current Situation

### ✅ Local Development
- **League Detection**: Working perfectly ✅
  - Detects "Mercenaries" as current PoE 2 league
  - Detects "Settlers" as current PoE 1 league
  - Auto-discovery working for new leagues
- **Data Collection**: Functional ✅
  - Currency data: 102+ types for Settlers, 104+ for Mercenaries
  - Ladder data: System can collect from all active leagues
  - Database: Contains 2,000+ characters from Settlers league

### ❌ Deployed Version Issues
- **Docker Image**: Last built June 9, 2025 (1 week ago)
- **GitHub Actions**: Failing since our CI import fixes
- **Access**: Cloudflare Access blocking API access (service tokens not working)
- **Status**: Likely running old code that may not detect new leagues

## What This Means

### Expected Behavior (Old Deployed Version)
The deployed version is probably still trying to collect from:
- **Standard/Hardcore** (permanent leagues)
- **Necropolis** (if it was the active league when deployed)
- May **NOT** be collecting from:
  - Mercenaries (PoE 2 current league)
  - Latest Settlers data

### Local vs Deployed
- **Local**: ✅ Up-to-date with new league detection
- **Deployed**: ❌ Running week-old code, likely missing new leagues

## Next Steps Required

### 1. Fix CI/CD Pipeline ⚠️
```bash
# The GitHub Actions are failing - need to:
1. Fix the failing tests in CI
2. Get a successful build/deploy
3. Update the deployed Docker image
```

### 2. Verify Deployment Access 🔐
```bash
# Check if the service is running on UNRAID
# Cloudflare Access needs proper configuration
# Service tokens might need updating
```

### 3. Force New Deployment 🚀
```bash
# Option 1: Fix CI and push
git push origin main

# Option 2: Manual deployment from local
docker build -t callmebeachy/jokerz-builds:latest .
docker push callmebeachy/jokerz-builds:latest

# Option 3: Update deployment to pull latest
# (depends on how UNRAID is configured)
```

## Immediate Impact

### Data Collection Gap 📊
The deployed version is likely:
- ❌ Missing Mercenaries league data (PoE 2)
- ❌ May have incomplete Settlers data
- ✅ Still collecting from permanent leagues (Standard/Hardcore)

### Discord Bot Impact 🤖
If connected to the deployed database:
- Limited league data available
- May show outdated league information
- Build analysis based on older meta

## Recommended Action Plan

1. **Priority 1**: Fix CI pipeline and deploy new code
2. **Priority 2**: Verify UNRAID deployment is pulling latest
3. **Priority 3**: Update Cloudflare Access for monitoring
4. **Priority 4**: Add deployment monitoring/health checks

## Current Assessment

**Local Development**: 🟢 Ready for new leagues  
**Deployed Production**: 🔴 Needs update to collect new league data
